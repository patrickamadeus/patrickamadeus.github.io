## About Me

- I am a _first-year_ **PhD Student** at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) 🤖, where I focus on multimodal NLP topics, particularly in vision-language interaction. I venture around VLM and UMM alignment, interpretability, and evaluation.

- I am also a **Research Engineer** at SMU 🇸🇬, working under the supervision of [Prof. Chong-Wah Ngo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HM39HrUAAAAJ&hl=en). Our current research work lies at the intersection of multilingual and multimodal interpretation. 

- Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in CS from Institut Teknologi Bandung, where I worked under [Prof. Ayu Purwarianti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8jUro_cAAAAJ&hl=en) on explainable multimodal synthetic data generation. Aside from research, I also do AI Engineering for various use cases. You can see my other experiences [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickamadeus/).

## Research Interests

At the moment, I often explore the following topics, ordered by the degree of my interest and experience:
1. **Multimodal Alignment:** Vision-language models (VLMs), unified multimodal models (UMMs), and multimodal alignment through both architectural and non-architectural adaptations (e.g., test-time optimization, data reformulation, prompting, RL, etc.).
2. **Multimodal Interpretability:** Diagnosis of modality imbalance (bimodal, trimodal, cross-modal), neuron-level intervention, analysis of modality attention distribution, and task-specific gradient reweighting.
3. **Domain-specific Multimodal Applications:** Large-scale data curation and the development of multilingual and multicultural multimodal benchmarks.
