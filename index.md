## About Me

- I am a **Research Engineer** at SMU 🇸🇬, working under the supervision of [Prof. Chong-Wah Ngo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HM39HrUAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research work lies at the intersection of multilingual and multimodal learning. 

- Starting this fall, I will begin my PhD at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) 🤖, where I plan to focus on multimodal representation learning, particularly in vision-language interaction.

- Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in CS from Institut Teknologi Bandung, where I worked under [Prof. Ayu Purwarianti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8jUro_cAAAAJ&hl=en) on explainable multimodal synthetic data generation. Aside from research, I also do AI Engineering for various use cases. You can see my other experiences [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickamadeus/).

## Research Interests

At the moment, I often explore the following topics, ordered by the magnitude of interest and experience:
1.	**Multimodal Learning/Alignment:** VLMs, multimodal alignment, efficient multimodal architectures, agentic/multimodal RAG.
2.	**Multilingual Alignment:** Language alignment, language taxonomy, low-resource alignment, domain-specific benchmarking.
3.	**Reasoning Architectures:** Advanced decoding strategies, efficient reasoning, hallucination mitigation.
